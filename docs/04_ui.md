## Spark UI (supporting tool)

Scope: observe execution. Use it to validate claims in Frameworks and Performance; not a decision guide by itself.

This part provides an always-on Spark session with small jobs to explore the Spark UI: `02_ui/03_spark_ui_demo.py`.

### What it covers
- Launch Spark UI at `http://localhost:4040`
- Generate a few RDD/DataFrame/SQL jobs to populate UI tabs
- Explore Jobs, Stages, SQL, Executors, and Environment tabs

### What you would see if you ran it
- Application ID, Spark version
- Outputs from three small example jobs
- Continuous keep-alive logs

### Key ideas
- Use the UI to understand execution plans, stages, and task distribution
- Small, controlled jobs make it easier to correlate console and UI

### File
- `02_ui/03_spark_ui_demo.py`

### Generated output
- `docs/generated/ui_01_spark_ui_demo.md`
