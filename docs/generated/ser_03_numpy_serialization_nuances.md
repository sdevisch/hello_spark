==================================================
🌐 Spark UI: http://localhost:4040

==================================================
📊 CREATING TEST DATA IN SPARK - REALISTIC STARTING POINT
==================================================
💡 REAL-WORLD SCENARIO:
   - Data starts in Spark (from files, databases, etc.)
   - We'll convert to NumPy to demonstrate serialization boundaries
   - Focus: When does serialization happen within NumPy operations?
⏱️  Creating Spark DF and converting to NumPy
   📤 Converting Spark → pandas → NumPy (SERIALIZATION)
   ✅ 2.833182s | Memory: +0.082GB

✅ Started with Spark DataFrame, converted to 7 NumPy arrays
💾 Total NumPy size: 3.9 MB
🎯 Now we'll analyze serialization boundaries within NumPy operations

==================================================
✅ NUMPY OPERATIONS - NO SERIALIZATION
==================================================
💡 THESE OPERATIONS STAY IN C (NO SERIALIZATION):
   - Array arithmetic and math functions
   - Array slicing and views
   - Aggregations (sum, mean, etc.)
   - Boolean indexing and masking
   - Array reshaping and transposing
⏱️  Arithmetic operations (*, +, sqrt, sin, comparisons)

   ✅ 0.000690s | Memory: +0.002GB

🎯 NO-SERIALIZATION OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE:
   Arithmetic operations:     0.000954s
   Slicing & reshaping:       0.000413s
   Aggregations:              0.001860s
   Advanced operations:       0.000690s
   💡 All operations stay in C - blazing fast!

==================================================
⚠️  SERIALIZATION BOUNDARIES - WHERE PYTHON KICKS IN
==================================================
💡 SERIALIZATION HAPPENS WHEN:
   - Extracting individual scalar values
   - Converting to Python lists/tuples
   - Pickling for inter-process communication
   - String representations and printing
   - Some NumPy functions that return Python objects
⏱️  Scalar extraction (array[0], array[-1]) - SERIALIZATION
   ✅ 0.000020s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Array to list conversion (.tolist()) - MASS SERIALIZATION
   ✅ 0.000005s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  String representation (str, repr) - FULL SERIALIZATION
   ✅ 0.000204s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Pickling operations (serialize/deserialize) - SERIALIZATION
   ✅ 0.000045s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Memory analysis (views vs copies vs Python objects)
   ✅ 0.000032s | Memory: +0.000GB

💾 MEMORY USAGE COMPARISON (for 100 float64 elements):
   NumPy view:        80 bytes per element
   NumPy copy:        8,000 bytes per element
   Python objects:    32 bytes per element
   Python overhead:   -100% more memory!

⚠️  SERIALIZATION BOUNDARIES PERFORMANCE:
   Scalar extraction:     0.000020s
   List conversion:       0.000005s
   String operations:     0.000204s
   Pickling operations:   0.000045s
   Memory analysis:       0.000032s
   💡 These operations cross the C/Python boundary!

==================================================
🔄 SPARK SERIALIZATION VS NUMPY BOUNDARIES
==================================================
💡 COMPARISON OF SERIALIZATION COSTS:
   - NumPy scalar extraction: Minimal (single value)
   - NumPy list conversion: Moderate (all elements)
   - Spark toPandas(): Heavy (inter-process + format conversion)
⏱️  Create Spark DataFrame from NumPy
   ✅ 0.037191s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  NumPy boundary operations (scalars + lists)
   ✅ 0.000018s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Spark → pandas → NumPy conversion
   ✅ 0.474570s | Memory: +0.000GB

⚖️  SERIALIZATION COST COMPARISON:
   NumPy boundaries (1000 elements):   0.000018s
   Spark serialization (1000 elements): 0.474570s
   Spark overhead factor:               25850.5x
   💡 Spark serialization is much heavier than NumPy boundaries!

==================================================
💡 PRACTICAL GUIDELINES - AVOIDING UNNECESSARY SERIALIZATION
==================================================
✅ GOOD PRACTICES (Avoid serialization):
   - Use vectorized operations instead of loops
   - Extract scalars only when necessary
   - Use array slicing instead of list conversion
   - Keep computations in NumPy as long as possible
   - Use views instead of copies when possible
⏱️  Good practices (vectorized, stay in NumPy)
   ✅ 0.000518s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Bad practices (loops, lists, conversions)
   ✅ 0.001179s | Memory: +0.000GB

📊 PRACTICE COMPARISON:
   Good practices (vectorized):    0.000518s
   Bad practices (serialization):  0.001179s
   Performance difference:         2.3x slower
   💡 Vectorized operations are much faster!

🎯 RESULTS VERIFICATION:
   Good method count: 49807
   Bad method count:  4982
   Results match:     False
   💡 Same results, but vastly different performance!

==================================================
🏆 NUMPY SERIALIZATION NUANCES SUMMARY
==================================================

🎯 KEY LEARNINGS:

✅ NO SERIALIZATION (Stay in C):
   • Array arithmetic and math functions
   • Slicing, reshaping, transposing (views)
   • Aggregations (sum, mean, std, median)
   • Boolean indexing and masking
   • Advanced operations (dot, sort, where)
   💡 These operations are blazing fast!

⚠️  SERIALIZATION OCCURS (C → Python):
   • Scalar extraction: array[0], array[-1]
   • List conversion: array.tolist()
   • String representation: str(array)
   • Pickling for storage/transmission
   • Individual element assignment from Python
   💡 These cross the C/Python boundary!

🔄 SERIALIZATION HIERARCHY (lightest → heaviest):
   1. NumPy scalar extraction     (single element)
   2. NumPy list conversion       (all elements)
   3. Spark → pandas conversion   (inter-process + format)
   📊 Spark overhead: 25850.5x vs NumPy boundaries

💡 PRACTICAL GUIDELINES:
   ✅ DO: Use vectorized operations
   ✅ DO: Keep computations in NumPy
   ✅ DO: Extract scalars sparingly
   ✅ DO: Use array slicing over list conversion
   ❌ AVOID: Python loops over arrays
   ❌ AVOID: Unnecessary .tolist() conversions
   📊 Performance difference: 2.3x

🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK:
   • Single values needed → Use scalar extraction
   • Multiple operations → Stay vectorized
   • Data exchange needed → Consider format carefully
   • Performance critical → Profile boundary crossings

💎 GOLDEN RULE:
   'Stay in NumPy's C layer as long as possible'
   'Cross boundaries only when absolutely necessary'
