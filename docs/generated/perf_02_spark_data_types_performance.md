ðŸ”¢ SPARK DATA TYPES PERFORMANCE DEMO
==================================================
ðŸ“Š Dataset size: 500,000 rows
ðŸŽ¯ Focus: Data type impact on performance & memory
==================================================
ðŸš€ Starting comprehensive Spark data types performance analysis...

ðŸ”¸ SCENARIO 1: Strings vs Correct Data Types
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“‹ Creating sample datasets...
Testing: Everything as STRING types...
Testing: CORRECT data types...
ðŸ”´ Strings approach:
   Load time: 3.052s
   Operation time: 0.456s
   Total time: 3.508s
   Estimated DataFrame size: 85.8 MB
ðŸŸ¢ Correct types approach:
   Load time: 2.396s
   Operation time: 0.623s
   Total time: 3.019s
   Estimated DataFrame size: 29.1 MB
âš¡ Speedup with correct types: 1.16x

ðŸ”¸ SCENARIO 2: 64-bit vs Right-sized Data Types
----------------------------------------
Creating optimized datasets for fair comparison...
Testing: OVERSIZED 64-bit types...
Testing: RIGHT-SIZED data types...
ðŸ”´ Oversized 64-bit types:
   Load time: 0.390s
   Operation time: 0.463s
   Total time: 0.853s
   Estimated DataFrame size: 32.9 MB
ðŸŸ¢ Right-sized types:
   Load time: 0.269s
   Operation time: 0.315s
   Total time: 0.584s
   Estimated DataFrame size: 17.2 MB
âš¡ Speedup with right-sized types: 1.46x
ðŸ’¾ Memory savings: 47.8%

ðŸ”¸ SCENARIO 3: Join Performance Impact
----------------------------------------
ðŸ“‹ Creating sample datasets...
Testing: STRING-based join...
Testing: INTEGER-based join...
ðŸ”´ String-based join: 1.661s
ðŸŸ¢ Integer-based join: 1.514s
âš¡ Join speedup: 1.10x

ðŸ“‹ SPARK DATA TYPES PERFORMANCE SUMMARY REPORT
============================================================

ðŸ”¸ STRINGS vs CORRECT TYPES:
   Performance improvement: 1.16x faster
   Time saved: 0.489s
   Memory difference: 56.7MB

ðŸ”¸ 64-BIT vs RIGHT-SIZED TYPES:
   Performance improvement: 1.46x faster
   Time saved: 0.269s
   Memory saved: 47.8%

ðŸ”¸ JOIN PERFORMANCE:
   Integer vs String join speedup: 1.10x faster

ðŸ’¡ KEY TAKEAWAYS:
   â€¢ Use correct data types instead of strings for significant performance gains
   â€¢ Right-size your data types to save memory and improve cache efficiency
   â€¢ Integer joins are much faster than string joins
   â€¢ Type casting during operations adds unnecessary overhead
   â€¢ Memory efficiency directly impacts Spark's ability to cache and process data
