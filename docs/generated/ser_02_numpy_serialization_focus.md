🚀 Starting Spark-to-NumPy Serialization Demo...
💻 System: 18.0GB RAM
🔢 SPARK-TO-NUMPY SERIALIZATION DEMO
==================================================
📊 Dataset size: 500,000 rows
🎯 Scenario: Data starts in Spark (realistic use case)
==================================================
🌐 Spark UI (No Arrow): http://localhost:4040
🌐 Spark UI (With Arrow): http://localhost:4041

==================================================
📊 CREATING TEST DATA IN SPARK - REALISTIC STARTING POINT
==================================================
💡 REAL-WORLD SCENARIO:
   - Data typically starts in Spark (from files, databases, etc.)
   - Data already distributed across Spark cluster
   - Question: Should we stay in Spark or move to NumPy/pandas?
⏱️  Creating Spark DataFrames
   ✅ 2.5937s | Memory: +0.000GB

✅ Created Spark DataFrames with 500,000 rows
💾 Data distributed across Spark cluster (cached in memory)
🎯 Now we'll compare: Stay in Spark vs Move to NumPy

==================================================
⚖️  OPTION 1: STAY IN SPARK - NO SERIALIZATION
==================================================
💡 WHY NO SERIALIZATION WHEN STAYING IN SPARK:
   - Data already in Spark cluster (JVM)
   - All operations happen in distributed JVM processes
   - No data movement between Python driver and executors
   - Spark's Catalyst optimizer handles execution
⏱️  Spark basic arithmetic (x² + y²)
   ✅ 0.0092s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Spark math functions (sqrt, sin, cos)
   ✅ 0.0125s | Memory: +0.000GB
⏱️  Spark aggregations (groupBy)
   ✅ 0.0210s | Memory: +0.000GB

🎯 SPARK OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE (NO SERIALIZATION):
   Basic arithmetic:  0.0092s
   Math functions:    0.0125s
   Aggregations:      0.0210s
   💡 All operations stay in Spark JVM - no serialization overhead!

==================================================
📤 OPTION 2: MOVE TO NUMPY - SERIALIZATION REQUIRED
==================================================
💡 WHY SERIALIZATION IS REQUIRED:
   - Must move data from Spark JVM to Python process
   - Distributed data → single-machine arrays
   - But enables NumPy's optimized operations
⏱️  Convert Spark → NumPy (no Arrow) - EXPENSIVE
   ✅ 0.5727s | Memory: +0.158GB
⏱️  Convert Spark → NumPy (with Arrow) - OPTIMIZED
   ✅ 0.1284s | Memory: +0.048GB

⚡ NUMPY OPERATIONS AFTER CONVERSION - NO SERIALIZATION:
⏱️  NumPy operations (all computations)
   ✅ 0.0166s | Memory: +0.019GB

📊 CONVERSION COST COMPARISON:
   Spark → NumPy (no Arrow):  0.5727s
   Spark → NumPy (with Arrow): 0.1284s
   Arrow speedup:              4.5x

⚡ COMPUTATION SPEED COMPARISON:
   Spark operations:           0.0427s
   NumPy operations:           0.0166s
   NumPy speedup:              2.6x

🎯 TOTAL TIME ANALYSIS:
   Stay in Spark:              0.0427s
   Convert to NumPy + compute: 0.1451s
   ✅ Winner: Stay in Spark (3.4x faster)

==================================================
🎯 WHY NUMPY IS FAST AFTER CONVERSION
==================================================
💡 NUMPY'S PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES:
   1. Vectorized operations - SIMD instructions
   2. Contiguous memory layout - cache friendly
   3. Compiled C code - no Python interpreter overhead
   4. Optimized libraries - BLAS, LAPACK integration
   5. Single-machine efficiency - no distributed overhead

==================================================
🏆 SPARK-TO-NUMPY PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
==================================================

🎯 KEY LEARNINGS FROM REALISTIC SCENARIO:

🚀 WHEN DATA STARTS IN SPARK:
   • Staying in Spark = No serialization overhead
   • Spark operations leverage distributed computing
   • All computation happens in JVM cluster
   • Good for large-scale data processing

📤 WHEN MOVING TO NUMPY:
   • Serialization cost: Spark → pandas → NumPy
   • Arrow provides 4-6x serialization speedup
   • NumPy operations much faster once converted
   • Best for intensive mathematical computations

⚖️ DECISION FRAMEWORK:
   Spark operations:           0.0427s
   NumPy conversion + ops:     0.1451s
   ✅ For this workload: Stay in Spark

💡 PRACTICAL DECISION GUIDE:
   • Heavy math/stats → Consider NumPy conversion
   • Large data processing → Stay in Spark
   • Multiple reuses → NumPy conversion pays off
   • One-time operations → Stay in Spark
   • Always use Arrow for conversions!
